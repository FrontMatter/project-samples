This article highlights why I will continue to have employment... 

Somewhere out there, some company (or government agency) is so confused about technology, they need someone like me to help them make sense of it! (They don't seem to understand that computers don't sneeze and cannot catch human viruses...)

Now, if I could just secure a contract with an agency to fix their problems for $800,000+ USD per year... ;)
