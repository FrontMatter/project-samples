 Social media image sizes seem to change constantly.

 One moment you have the perfect cover page for your account. The next, it’s been resized, and looks all pixelated and wrong.

 It doesn’t help that information about official dimensions and image sizes is harder to find than a civil discussion on politics on Facebook.

 But, it’s not difficult if you consult this guide to social media image sizes on all important social media platforms!

 Below are the most recent social media image dimensions, as of 2022.


## Quick social media image sizes
 We go into more detail for every single network below, but this image includes the social media image sizes you probably look up most often.

## Instagram image sizes
 ![](./Social-Media-Image-Sizes-for-Every-Network/infographic_image-sizes_blog_post_Instagram.png.webp)

 Instagram supports horizontally and vertically oriented images. It also still supports square images, which was what the platform was known for when it first launched.

 This increases your brand’s options. But it also makes image dimensions a little trickier to get right. Follow these guidelines to make sure your images end up looking their best.

### Instagram profile photo size

 Instagram profile photos are displayed at 110 x 100 pixels, but the image files are stored at `320 x 320` pixels, so make sure to upload an image that’s least that big.


 Even though the dimensions are in a square format, Instagram profile photos are displayed as a circle. Make sure any elements you want to focus on in the photo are centered so they don’t get cropped out.


### Instagram image sizes for feed photos
 * **Landscape**: 1080 x 566 pixels
 * **Portrait**: 1080 x 1350 pixels
 * **Square**: 1080 x 1080 pixels
 * **Supported aspect ratios**: Anywhere between 1.91:1 and 4:5
 * **Recommended image size**: Width of 1080 pixels, height between 566 and 1350 pixels (depending on whether the image is landscape or portrait)

 **Tips**:
 * If you want your images to look their best on Instagram, aim to upload an image that is 1080 pixels wide.
 * When you share an Instagram image that’s sized over 1080 pixels, [Instagram will size it down](https://help.instagram.com/1631821640426723?helpref=search&sr=1&query=image%20sizes&search_session_id=c31733a739e5847e68b4ab7b72126f73) to 1080 pixels.
 * If you share a photo that has a resolution lower than 320 pixels, Instagram will size it up to 320 pixels.
 * If your image is between 320 and 1080 pixels wide, Instagram will keep that photo at its original resolution, “[as long as the photo’s aspect ratio is between 1.91:1 and 4:5](https://help.instagram.com/1631821640426723?helpref=search&sr=1&query=image%20sizes&search_session_id=c31733a739e5847e68b4ab7b72126f73) (a height between 566 and 1350 pixels with a width of 1080 pixels).”
 * If your uploaded Instagram image is a different ratio, the platform will automatically crop your photo to fit a supported ratio.

### Instagram photo thumbnail sizes
 * **Display size**: 161 x 161 pixels
 * **Recommended upload size**: 1080 pixels wide

 **Tips**:
 * Remember that Instagram stores versions of these thumbnails that are as large as 1080 x 1080.
 * To future-proof your Instagram feed and avoid pixelation, upload images that are as large as possible.


### Instagram Stories image size
 1080 x 1920 pixels
 **Tips**:
 * This is an aspect ratio of 9:16.
 * Uploading an image with a smaller pixel size (but the same aspect ratio) means the Story will buffer quickly.
 * If you don’t use this ratio, the Story might show with strange cropping, zooming, or leave large sections of the screen blank.
 * Instagram Reels use this same sizing.

### Instagram carousel image sizes
 * **Landscape**: 1080 x 566 pixels
 * **Portrait**: 1080 x 1350 pixels

 * **Recommended image size**: Width of 1080 pixels, height between 566 and 1350 pixels (depending on whether the image is landscape or portrait)


### Instagram Reels sizes
 * 1080 x 1920 pixels
 * This is an aspect ratio of 9:16.
 * Cover photo: 1080 x 1920 pixels

### Image sizes for Instagram Stories ads
 1080 x 1920 pixels

 **Tips**:
 * Instagram recommends leaving roughly “[14% (250 pixels) of the top and bottom of the image free from text and logos](https://www.facebook.com/business/ads-guide/image/instagram-story/reach)” to prevent them from being covered.
 * As of September 2020, Facebook and Instagram ads are no longer penalized if more than 20% of the ad space is text.
