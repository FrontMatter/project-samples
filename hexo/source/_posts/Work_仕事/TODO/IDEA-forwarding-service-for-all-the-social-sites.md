 Offer a service where people can add all your social/RSS services with one click... Instead of clicking on a dozen separate icons for each service, just click on one. (e.g. Tweet, facebook, linkedIn, etc...)
 
 Short-comings: need a method to ​retrieve user's ID for each service without invading and without asking the user to fill in a long form of ID info... Would need a sort-of auto-detect on the user's browser for info where the user approves of the data query.
