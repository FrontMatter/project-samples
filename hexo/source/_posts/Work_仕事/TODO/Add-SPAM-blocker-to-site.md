 Add a SPAM filter service (via API-backend call) to the front-end site.

 Use something like: http://akismet.com/development/
 It's relatively affordable.

 Get the API and integrate it with your blog. Write it to only enable when the API-Key is available. Otherwise, the API should be disabled -- this a​llows you to have the API ready for when you're ready to pay the monthly fees...

 **HATE the SPAM, not the users...**

 Note, there is a FREE version too!Just change the annual pay to $0/yr and they will email the "FREE" API key. There are supposedly limitations on bandwidth and number of queries/month... But for starters, this is great!
