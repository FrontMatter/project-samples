 I've been rather <i>busy</i> these past eight months. Between working a project that has consumed virtually every waking minute and trying to have a personal life, I have not contributed much to my personal website. But soon, I can see myself refocusing my efforts on this site.
 
 I have already rewritten the back-end that enables me to create these blog entries. With this part done, I should have little trouble in posting my thoughts more often. Before, I was literally writing SQL statements to create my posts. Now, I have a very nice interface to type them all up. :-)
 
 With that said, I still have a road-map to follow for this site's development. This has not really changed and will continue to be followed.
 
 <i>While every road has a detour, it's not the destination that makes it fun, but the challenges we face in getting there.</i>
