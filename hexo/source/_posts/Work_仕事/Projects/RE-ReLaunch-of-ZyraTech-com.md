 It seems that my idea of ZyraTech.com will have to be put on hold...  Due to my current projects giving me little room to focus on ZyraTech, I have shutdown the site. At a later date, when I can refocus my efforts... I <i>may</i> reopen that site. Until then, I'm afraid that it will be left on the "back burner" of sorts.
