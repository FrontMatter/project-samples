## Relearning the basics in Web design
 While I haven't really been doing much web design over the last few years, I have learned that advancements in JS/CSS have made things previously not easy now trivial.  <!-- more --> Below are some vidoes I found to be immensely useful in catching up with the latest advancements. Yes... I binge-watched all these videos so I could apply the lessons to this website. 

 Warning: this is a __very long__ post. The TOC on the right (PC view) will be helpful to skip to sections of interest.



## Tools
  One online tool to quickly build the components of your website or email template: https://designmodo.com/
  Use https://animate.style/ to preview various CSS animations.

### Learn Adobe XD in 2021 by Example
  Getting started in XD. Learn all about components, states, repeating grids, content aware layouts, plugins, auto-animate, scroll groups and much more.

### Visual Studio Code Plugin for Adobe XD
 Now that I'm familiar with Adobe XD, need to see how I could expedite my workflow by integrating it with VS code. Don' know what [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) is, but apparently this is something used between designers and front-end coders. I see a lot of potential with a tool like this, but doubt I would place more effort than required to get my websites up and running.

### Adobe XD to HTML CSS
 Before last month, I never knew what Adobe XD was for. I'm familiar with Illustrator and have experience with Photoshop, but never really used XD. With the rebuild website project, I discovered its value and have started understanding how it makes the mock-up process so much faster. Previously, I just used my iPad and sketched out a bunch of stuff. With XD and the web-export plugin, I can rapidly build a site. This video covers that process.

### Convert Adobe XD to Responsive HTML
 I'm very interested in how to make a responsive website. Something that looks good on the big 4K screens but transistions to the small handheld devices like an iPhone without writing a whole new website. (That's what they used to do over a decade ago.)

### Adobe XD Animation with CSS
 Use Animate.css with your HTML website exports in Adobe XD to replace the default Prototype and extend your creativity with native CSS animation transitions.  Animate.css is a library of ready-to-use, cross-browser animations for use in your web projects.

### Use FireFox to debug your CSS
 If you aren't already using Firefox for your dev browser, I strongly recommend it. Chrome's devtools are great, but Firefox's grid and flex inspector, among a few other of it's features, make it my go to. Even if you don't fully make the switch, if you're trying to learn grid and find it frustraing, you *need* to use it for the grid inspector and make your life so much easier.

## UX Design Course for Beginners
 I've seen people use UI and UX interchangeably when they are _not_ the same thing. UX is more entrenched in behavioral pyschology than graphics design. Whereas a UI designer is more like a coder that is concerned with the interface elements. The UX designer would instruct the UI designer how best to engage the customers/users. In larger organizations, the roles around a website design are divided up among at least six different roles. However, in a startup (like what I do), I'm often that one person that does it all. However, I'm likely to outsource the visual/graphics design.

## Typography
 As I have read a lot of books and online sites, I've observed a number of "unwritten rules" around the way information is presented. I've seen what I found easy to read versus simple content that is difficult to parse due to poor design choices. That said, I'm no expert at Lettering nor Typography. So, I've watched this "crash course" on the topic. I'm not concerned about Lettering so much as I'm not looking to display hand-written work.

### Improve your designs with these simple tricks to picking fonts
 Picking fonts can be a frustrating affair. Rather than diving deep into the world of typography, in this video I want to show you two super simple steps to how you can pick fonts for your site, and have them look great every single time!

### CSS & Topography
 There are a ton of CSS units out there, and the most underappreciated is, in my opinion at least, the ch unit.

### Don't set font-sizes using em
 A lot of people struggle with the difference between the ```em``` and ```rem``` units. While there can be situations where it works out, in general I suggest using ```rem``` for font-size, and I take a look at why in this video.

 - For font-sizes, always use "rem" to avoid compounding problem.
 - Use "em" for properties other than fontSize like margin, padding, width etc...
 - rem are useful when we are trying to use media queries

### Six simple typography tips
 Devs often struggle with the design of their sites. One thing that holds their designs back the most is the way they handle type, so in this video, we're looking at 6 simple steps for you to follow to make for better typography, which means a much nicer looking site :)

 1. Split the content up into groups
 2. Increase contrast through font-size
 3. Increase contrast through font-weight
 4. Increase contrast through color
 5. Increase the line-height of the body

### Marketing Color Psychology 
 What does marketing color psychology mean to you? Each color has positive and negative connotations, and you want to be careful of the messages you're sending. Watch this video all about the psychology of color before getting started on your own marketing graphics: https://www.visme.co
 This is why marketing color psychology is so essential to understand. Knowing how colors work together and what the different colors mean is key to creating beautiful designs.

 _NOTE_: Different cultures and languages have some very different color associations. Not everyone thinks of a certain color as associated with the same meanings. So try to learn about these color associations from different groups, by reading up on color.

### Writing responsive CSS the wrong way?
 I know sometimes it's because we have a design file that's only a layout as a desktop layout, or because it's just how we're used to working since we're on a desktop, but I'm writing mobile-first CSS not only results in less code, I also think it's a lot easier.

### Media queries & meta viewport
 Our phones assume that websites are NOT responsive, so if you don't tell them that you did all the hard work and set up some media queries, it'll just ignore all that and simply scale your website down to fit. Using the meta viewport tag, we can tell our devices that we did use media queries and prevent that from happening.

``` html
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
```

### Advanced CSS selectors
Most people know the basic selectors, but aren't aware that there are some really useful advanced selectors as well.

### Support keyboard focus / navigation
 You are doing :focus wrong (and I was too)
 :focus is often, in the best case scenarios, ignored, and in the worst case scenarios, turned off.

 It's a very important part of writing good CSS though! Not everyone is in your exact situation, and many people will navigate the page with the keyboard instead of their mouse. Let's make their life as easy as possible too :)

### Block, Inline, and Inline-Block
 Understaning how block, inline, and inline-block each behave is very important when learning CSS, as well as knowing why you might want to switch the display property of an element every now and then.

### Flexbox design patterns 
 Flexbox is amazing, and I honestly feel like sometimes we're just stratching the surface with what we can do with it! In this video I explore three design patterns that you can use in your sites using flexbox.

### What is display: flow-root
 The CSS display property used to be so simple, but there are more and more options for it now, from the more well known things like display: flex and grid, to the lesser-known display: flow-root. It would have been *really* nice to have had this about 7 years ago, but better late than never, as we see in this video 😊

### Build a Mosaic Portfolio Layout - Grid
 The CSS Grid is here, and this is my first real look at how to use it. To start with, I wanted to look at how we can make a cool looking layout in the simplest way possible, so all we're dealing with here is setting up the grid template, and then using spans to get things the size we need. Once the initial layout is done, I look at how you can add in an image and hover effect, and then I follow that up by looking at how easy it is to add more items to your layout.

### Container queries - 2020
 Long thought impossible, Heydon Pickering has found a way to replicate the idea of container queries using a cool CSS trick / hack using a clever combination of flex-wrap, flex-basis, and flex-grow. It's a really powerful trick. We'll still need media queries for stuff, but this could prove to be really, really handy!

 Heydon's original article on The Holy Albatross: https://heydonworks.com/article/the-flexbox-holy-albatross/

### Container queries - 2021
 I think container queries easily have the potential to be as big of a game-changer as flexbox was back in the day. They are going to change the way we approach creating layouts. 

 The proposal by Miriam Suzanne build on top of David Baron’s, and is what is currently being implemented into Chrome Canary (behind a flag), so a huge thank you to her for being at the forefront of making this actually happen! 

 //////////// UPDATE ///////////
 If you want to try them out, the `contain` property now has a new requirement, with the `style` value.
 ```contain: layout style inline-size;```

 Heads up, this is only working in Firefox right now, and even then, only partially supported! This video is a part of my look ahead at what's coming to CSS 😊. As I mention in the video, I also recently talked about container queries, which are sooo exciting.

### min(), max(), and clamp()
 CSS has come a long way, but min(), max(), and clamp() make a lot of things a lot easier than they used to be, and really open up the world of responsive typography like we never had before! Clamp() is the ingredient that we've needed for a long time to really be able to make type fully responsive in our CSS, and to be able to do it on one line is absolute magic!

 In this video we're exploring some awesome CSS hover effects that we can create using transforms and transform-origin and pseudo-elements.

I feel that these types of effects really highlight how a strong understanding of the fundamentals really helps to make this stuff possible, because without knowing about stacking context, or even simpler things like absolute positioning, this stuff would be a nightmare!

### Sass | @use and @forward
 Keep up to date with my Sass course: https://learnsass.com

 The use of @import has been deprecated in Sass for quite a while now, but a *lot* of people still use it. In this video, I take a quick look at the replacements you should be using instead, @use and @forward. I just scratch the surface in this one, but it should be enough to get you started!

 A quick note, if you are using node-sass, it is out of date and @use and @forward, as well as their entire module system, will not work. If you're using the Watch Sass extension in VS Code, there is no way to update it. If you are using npm or yarn, just switch out the install of node-sass for sass instead. 

 Why Sass changed to Dart: https://sass-lang.com/blog/announcing-dart-sass

 One of the best ways to learn is to find fun designs on existing websites and to try and recreate them, so with that in mind, we're taking the animated card design from the Top Games section over at [PopDog](https://popdog.com) and seeing if we can recreate it with only HTML and CSS!

### Setting up Font Awesome icons as pseudo-elements
 Font Awesome is really useful for quickly adding icons to a project that you're working on, but often they're more decorative than anything else, which is why it can be really useful to use pseudo-elements to insert them, rather than adding in empty elements. 

 In this video, we look at adding them in, and some different ways you can approach it, by adding them to the card I started work on last week.

### Creating a responsive, asymmetrical design with HTML & CSS
 Layouts like this used to be a huge pain, but with the more modern tools that are being introduced to CSS, like ```grid```, ```subgrid```, ```flexbox``` and some fun functions like ```clamp()``` things are getting *so much easier*!

## Email design
 Creating emails formatted in HTML is similar to building a single-page-website. However, there are some limitations for images and other visual elements included in the email document. Another thing to consider is overall file size which must include all images. Very few providers allow large email sizes. So, keep this in mind while designing the email template.
 Design considerations should include whether to embed the images or to host them from your web servers. Know that hosted images are blocked from download by default from many email applications (for security reasons). However, embedded images are always displayed. Probably a good idea to keep the logo and any critical images embedded while the rest of the images are hosted.
 All CSS must be embedded as well. Not recommended to host this as there is limited support from email applications. Email applications also don't support a style section. All CSS must be *inline* with the elements. (This also increases the email size, unfortunately.)

 In general, you need several templates for your website:
 * Promotional / Marketing
 * Tranactional
 * Annoucement
 * Seasonal
 * Newsletter
