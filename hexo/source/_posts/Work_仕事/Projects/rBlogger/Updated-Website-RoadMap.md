 Since the last time I published my roadmap for this site, I have divided my attention on a number of higher priorities related to my gainful employment. However, when I managed to<i> spare some time</i>, I have continued to work on my website.  Unfortunately, you may not have noticed them since my focus has been on the back-end administration of my site. 

 ​Below is my <i>updated</i> high-level overview:


1. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Basic blog front-end for read only.</span> (Done)

2. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Extend the base blog features into the travel section.</span> (Done)


3. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Support 日本語 language in backend database.</span> (Done)

4. Develop the Back-end Admin modules for easier management of this site. (in progress)

5. Develop new Resume section. (requires back-end admin-module to be complete)
6. ReDesign website (public facing side) to refocus on the blog. 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Merge Travel and Blog sections.
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Color theme may remain the same.
7. Change homepage to "<font color="#0000ff"> Meet Richie　／ 理路に始めて</font> " 
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Include a full length (Professional) picture of myself.
8. Add the advanced features to the base blog including user invites, search and posts.
9. <span style="text-decoration: line-through;">Add 日本語 module to the language directory for localization.</span> (Done)

10. Add RSS feature to travel/blog sections.



Stay tuned!
