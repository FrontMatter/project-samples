This week, my priorities have been divided between my personal life and professional obiligations. I had originally intended to have 90+% of this site completed by today. However, as experience has indicated, rare is a project that actually runs according to plan and schedule. Nevertheless, I am pushing on. I do expect to have the contact form fully operational by the end of today. I intend to have all my resumes properly posted  here by Monday. (I'm fully aware of the broken links.)
So, I have to ask you to bare with me as this site enters its second week of existance.
