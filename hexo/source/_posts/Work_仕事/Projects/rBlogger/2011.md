 The new year has arrived and I have renewed the development of my website (RichieBartlett.com). The new users management module is virtually complete. Something I wanted to have done 6 months ago until Life's hardships interrupted. I will be moving on the to attachment/upload managers. After that, I plan to rewrite the Resume manager section.
 
 My road map for this site has not changed much. However, with all the new "invisible" features getting built on the back-end, I will need to redesign the look and feel of the website. The blog section can handle multiple forums and I would like to display these threads on my site. For as long as Life keeps the curve balls to a minimum, I will continue to develop this website.
