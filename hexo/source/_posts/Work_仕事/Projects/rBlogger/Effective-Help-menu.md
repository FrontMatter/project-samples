 <span style="background-color: rgb(255, 153, 0);">​This can be generalized to the entire program's structure rather than focused to the help menu...</span><br><p>Experts have identified five characteristics to make a help menu effective:<sup id="cite_ref-32" class="reference"><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Customer_relationship_management#cite_note-32"><span>[</span>33<span>]</span></a></sup></p>
<ul><li>“context-specific” — the help menu contains only the information relevant to the topic that is being discussed or sought</li><li>“useful“ — in conjunction with being context-specific, the help menu must be comprehensive in including all of the information that the user seeks</li><li>“obvious to invoke“ — the user must have no trouble in locating the help menu or how to gain access to its contents</li><li>“non-intrusive“ — the help menu must not interfere with the user’s primary path of work and must maintain a distance that allows for its use only when requested</li><li>“easily available“ — the information of the help menu must be accessible with little or few steps required</li></ul>
