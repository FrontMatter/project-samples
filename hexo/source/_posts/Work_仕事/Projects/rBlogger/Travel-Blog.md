 I finally got around to creating the front-end (data view) for my travel log section!
 
 My vision is for this to display like a photo album that you can double-click to open up the travel log. Additionally, I want to display more pictures inside the travel log for a better sense of story-telling.
 
 Soon, I will enable the double-click features to actually open up the logs within a TAB-panel.<
 
 :D  stay tuned!
