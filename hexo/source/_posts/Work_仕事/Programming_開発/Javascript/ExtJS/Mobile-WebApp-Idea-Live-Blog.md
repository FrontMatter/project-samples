 Idea for web-based blog that utilizes a mobile phone with camera, compass, and geoLocation...

 Create a MobileWebApp (target iPhone) that will enable me to travel anywhere and immediately upload a video or photo directly to my online blog complete with google map-data.​


 Technologies that can be used:

Sencha.com
PhoneGap.com
Raphael.js

LAMP back-end.


Example usage/application of this webApp:
<ul><li>Traveling to Mount Fuji (or somewhere in Japan) in the Summer(any season) time.</li><li>Taking several photos with iPhone of the scene I\\''m at.</li><li>webApp would capture the google map-data and photo upload for use in blog.</li><li>From blog entry form, show image and allow text entry of events to share.</li><li>blog entry would allow multiple photos/videos to be linked into a single blog.</li></ul>
