* <B>DON'T</B> waste money on:
  -  Things that you don't enjoy

## The Hidden Brilliance of Stealth Wealth - How Money Works
 Why would you want to be rich? Is it because you want to be able to relax all day instead of doing a shitty job? Is it because you want to be able to look after your friends and family? Is it because you want to do things that just aren’t possible without a lot of cash? 

 Or maybe, is it because you want to show off a bit… Make your parents proud, be the one who gets the most attention at your high school reunion, or just flex on the gram to prove all your haters wrong. 

 Don’t be ashamed of it, there is a trillion dollar industry built on enabling this kind of behavior, so you are certainly not alone, but there is a better way.
