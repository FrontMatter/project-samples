 Cool Idea:
   I wonder how a "RealTime, Real-World Game" would be received in Japan?

 My idea is to build a mobile app (Android & IOS compatible) that would create target points on a map and require certain challenges to be met before in game points are rewarded. The mobile app would use GPS to track your progress and pop "in game" *easter eggs* along the way to your next real-world point. Game rewards can include products and cash prizes as well as in-game exchanges.

 The service would include calling or texting users while they are *in-game*. It could even interface with G+, twitter, & Facebook and get your friends involved!

 What do you think of this idea?
