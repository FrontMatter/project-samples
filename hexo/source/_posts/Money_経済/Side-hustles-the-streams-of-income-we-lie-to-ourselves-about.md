 While many of us consider adding an income stream (or three) to our wallets, it's prudent to think about the realities of what a side-hustle involves. Those that have "made it" don't really focus on just how hard it was to endure ***years*** of hardships, sleepless nights, and hazarding one's health just to make an "extra buck." Not to mention that it's not a long-term solution that you could sustain before your body forces you to make a choice. It makes no sense to build up a ton of wealth if you have to use that wealth to repair your body. 
 
 This doesn't mean that you should never consider a side-hustle to begin with... but before you do, make sure it offers *all* of the following
  1. It must make money.
  2. It must have a flexible schedule.
  3. You must be capable of doing it.
  4. Can you make it your main job?

 The Lies You Have Been Told About Side Hustles & Multiple Streams of Income - How Money Works

 Side hustles and hustle culture in general might look harmless, after all what’s the problem with motivated individuals doing a little bit of extra work to put some more money in their pockets? Maybe side hustles can do some good, and I promise I will look at some examples that do genuinely make some sense in this vide. 

 But as always my main goal is to try and ruin a good thing and show you that this push to normalize and incentivize side hustles is something we probably shouldn’t be too excited about.
