## Seth Godin - How to Get Your Ideas to Spread 
 Seth Godin, the world-renowned marketing and leadership author inspires us on how to get our ideas spread when mass marketing and traditional advertising have moved to the past. 

 Key points:
 • Mass marketing and traditional advertising don’t work anymore.
 • Everyone is a click away, which means that both opportunities, but also  competition, are increasing.
 • “People like us (do things like this)”  - the job of the marketer is to find the people like us and determine what do things like this really mean. 
 • The winners will be those who can find the right niche and lead them.

 Questions to consider:
 • What is the niche customer segment your product or service is for?
 • How can you reach and lead that group?
 • How can you make your customers feel that you see and hear them?

## Seth Godin – Leadership vs. Management - What it means to make a difference
 The world-renowned marketing and leadership author Seth Godin talks about the difference between leadership and management, the confusion surrounding them, and why the world needs more leaders.

 Key Points:
 * Management works well in terms of increasing economic efficiency and productivity. But, in the face of rapid change, the world needs leadership to get through this stage of unprecedented transformation.
 * You should strive for excellence. Producing something truly great is the only way to build competitive advantage because sophisticated robots, artificial intelligence, and low-paid labor will handle the trivial job of assuring quality.
 * You should focus on “soft skills” which are actually “real skills”. Those are the characteristics that differentiate a potential employee from a robot.
 * Effective leadership can help companies navigate difficulties and failures, and eventually find successful processes to get forward.
 * A leader solves problems even if they are not on his agenda.
 * Write your own story.
 * Quitting is for winners not losers but you should know when to quit. 

 Questions to consider:
 * How can you become more of a leader than a manager?
 * How can you and your organization strive for excellence instead of just quality?
 * Are you focusing on real skills?
 * How can you make better processes in order to fail more efficiently?

 Questions you ask as a designer:
 * What are you trying to do?
 * Articulate your objectives using absolutely no jargon.
 * What is new in your approach and why do you think it will be successful?
 * Who care?! If you are successful, what difference will it make?
 * What are the risks?
 * How much will it cost?
 * How long will it take?
 * What are the mid-term and final "exams" to check for success?
