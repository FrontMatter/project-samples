 ## Vertical farming and Microgreens
 For the last few years, I've been following [vertical farming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vertical_farming) and the latest (related) craze of [microgreens](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Microgreen). Seems that a lot of people are interested in the healthful benefits of eating "right" and it's effects of strengthening the body against Covid-19. This is another potential income stream I could develop and have Aki-chan manage with the boys.

 Below is all the video research I've found of interest to share in my blog.

### The High-Tech Vertical Farmer * Video (8 minutes)
 In the kale-filled facility at vertical farm startup Bowery Farming, it’s a piece of proprietary software that makes most of the critical decisions -- like when to harvest and how much to water each plant. But it still takes humans to carry out many tasks around the farm. Katie Morich, 25, loves the work. But as roboticists make gains, will her employer need her forever? This is the fourth episode of Next Jobs, a series about careers of the future hosted by Bloomberg Technology's Aki Ito.

### 5 Vertical Farms Run by AI and Robots * Video (8 minutes)
 One of the oldest and most fundamental professions in the world is agriculture and farming and looking back, humanity has come a long way over the millennia in how we farm and grow crops with the evolution of various technologies. Over time, as the world population continues to grow and land becomes more scarce, people have realized the need to get creative and become more efficient in farming.
 With the population of the world being the largest it has ever been, the responsibility to feed this ever-growing population is getting harder and harder which is why experts think that vertical farming is the future.
 Vertical farms are indoors and can be placed anywhere, making them crucial in a time where farmable land is on decline.

### Tokyo office grows own food in vertical farm  * Video (10 minutes)
 In a country with very little arable land (only 12% compared with 20% in the US), in one of the most populated cities in the world, one company chose to give up 43,000 square feet of valuable workspace to grow food. In the Tokyo headquarters of human resources company Pasona Group they grow 200 species of fruits and vegetables and even rice that are harvested and served to employees.

 The indoor urban farm doesn’t just provide food, but by mixing workspace and farm space, the company tries to provide a healthier quality of life for employees. Here green isn’t just a window dressing: immediately upon entering the building you walk over a 1,000-square-foot rice paddy, continue through an okra field and you enter the vine-covered “tomato guest room” or the “vegetable factory” filled with hundreds of hydroponic heads of lettuce. On the second floor, fruit trees form partition walls between meeting spaces, bean sprouts are grown under benches and herbs grow on shelving along the walls.

 Even the outside of the building is covered in plants helping keep the building cool in summer and warmer in winter. According to the farm’s designers Kono Designs, “it is the largest and most direct farm-to-table of its kind ever realized inside an office building in Japan.”
