 I've been interested in Solar technology for decades now, but have never owned a home to install it on. In that time, I've followed the basic tech to understand it better from an _return on investment_ viewpoint. While I like the tech, overall, I'm still of the opinion that it's still too expensive to own in Japan. However, if Japan were to prioritize more green energy initiatives, then perhaps more subsidies could make it more viable.

## 4 Year Update - Are Solar Panels for Home Still Worth It? | Video (13:37 minutes)
 Are they still worth it? It’s been almost 4 years since I had solar panels installed on my house.  In general they’ve been performing pretty close to what was promised, but last year threw us some curve balls.  I saw a pretty sharp decline in the amount of solar produced.  Since my solar panels are nearing their 4 year anniversary, I thought it would be a good idea to revisit what I’ve learned living with solar panels in an area you might not think they’d be good for, as well as what happened last year.  Do I still think getting solar panels was a good idea?  Let’s see if we can come to a decision on this.
