 [Previously](/2021/1007/Science_科学/Technology_技術/Geothermal-heating-system.html), I discussed using geothermal sources to heat up my future home. Here I consider how to use similar technology to power the electricity in my home. The long-term implications are astounding. However, the main reason we don't see this proliferate the globe is the upfront construction costs &mdash; drilling the bore-holes in the ground can be prohibitve.

## What is GeoThermal Energy?
 {% wikipedia title:Geothermal_energy wikiButton:true lang:en sentences:4 %}


## Geothermal in Japan
 Japan is among the countries that sit on the "[Ring of Fire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ring_of_Fire)" where geothermal and seismic activity are rather high. Despite the abundant sources of heat just below everyone's feet, Japan still imports a lot of dirty sources of fossil fuels (*e.g.* coal and gas). In fact, Japan is the third largest importer[^1][^2] (after India and China) for coal. 

[^1]: [Japan plans to gradually reduce coal imports from Russia](https://www.asahi.com/ajw/articles/14593661#:~:text=Russia%20was%20Japan's%20fifth%2Dbiggest,U.S.%20Energy%20Information%20Administration%20data.)
[^2]: [JAPAN'S ENERGY](https://www.enecho.meti.go.jp/en/category/brochures/pdf/japan_energy_2016.pdf)

 Japan does, however, have a handful geothermal plants scattered throughout the country[^3]. Unfortunately, they don't represent the majority share of the electrical power production. The three major barriers to wide-spread adoption are: 1) regulations on natural parks, 2) cost and development risk, and 3) social acceptance.

## Why don't we all use Geothermal Energy? | Video (14:37 minutes)
 Science tells us there's enough energy in the first 10 kilometres below our planet's surface to provide all our energy needs for millions of years. The Romans tapped into it for their hot water spas. Today, we all know it as Geothermal Energy. There's no carbon dioxide emissions and no air pollution with geothermal, and it's literally right there beneath our feet. So why isn't our entire planet powered by it?

## Geothermal Energy Explained - A Not So Hot Solution? | Video (11:35 minutes)
 Geothermal Energy Explained - A Not So Hot Solution?  What if I told you there was an always-on, carbon free, renewable power source deep beneath the earth's surface. Why haven't we been using this power source, literally available under our feet, as much as possible?  Let's look at the explanation behind Geothermal energy and it's challenges ... one of which is a little ... ground-breaking.

## Deep Geothermal at EDEN PROJECT | Video (19:51 minutes)
 Could geothermal power be the future of electricity generation? Robert visits Cornwall to find out how Eden Geothermal are unlocking geothermal energy in the granite beneath the ground. 

 Their seriously impressive geothermal drilling rig might be the same kit you use to drill for oil and gas, but instead they are targeting clean, natural, sustainable energy from the rocks deep below. This is the first phase of a two well development which will completely power the eco-focused Eden Project making it carbon neutral as well as potentially power 17,000 surrounding houses. 

 What is really exciting about this project is that it feels like the beginning of a new geothermal energy industry could be on the horizon.

## Why This Fusion Tech May Be a Geothermal Energy Breakthrough | Video (18:06 minutes)
 Why Fusion is the Key to the Future of Geothermal Energy. It hasn’t been the hottest renewable energy option because drilling deep enough into the earth is difficult and costly. A startup has recently unearthed a solution: A gyrotron heat ray to melt rocks (sort of). This is a well-established nuclear fusion technology being reapplied to geothermal energy. Could it unlock the true potential of geothermal energy and make it a better renewable energy source than solar and wind?
