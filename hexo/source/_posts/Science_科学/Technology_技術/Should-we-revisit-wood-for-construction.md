 When one thinks about a tall, durable buildings, often thoughts of steel and concrete come to mind. Even with graphine laced concrete, one should consider how material design and engineering has advanced significantly over the past thirty years. [CLT (cross-laminated timber)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-laminated_timber) (otherwise known as glulam) is proving to be quite strong and lightwieght compared to traditional steel and concrete.


## Construction's Graphene Revolution Has (Finally) Begun
 From super-strength concrete to fortified infrastructure, this is what the ‘wonder material for the 21st century’ is now bringing to construction.
