How do I block spam/crap that gets delivered to my cellphone email address? 
My ____@i.softbank.jp account has apparently been data-mined by some asshole and is bombarding my keitai with 20 spam mails per hour!!!

I'm getting pissed-off about this! It's hard to believe that IOS mail does not offer a block feature!
