# Panda antivirus mistakenly flags itself as malware, bricks PCs
*Users were warned not to restart their PCs, in case they wouldn't boot up again.*

It's the one time you'll hear IT warn you not to "turn it off and on again."

An update to a number of Panda antivirus programs Wednesday mistakenly flagged core files as malware, putting them in quarantine. In doing so, the antivirus system ceased working.

First [reported by The Register](http://www.theregister.co.uk/2015/03/11/panda_antivirus_update_self_pwn/), machines are left unstable, unusable, or unable to access the Internet.

Panda's free antivirus, retail 2015 service, and its enterprise cloud-based antimalware service are all affected. It's not clear how many machines are affected.

The company [took to Twitter](https://twitter.com/Panda_Security/status/575673483046297600) to warn users: "Please, don't reboot PCs. We'll keep you posted."

In [an advisory](http://www.pandasecurity.com/uk/homeusers/support/card?id=100045), Panda said the erroneous signature file was "repaired immediately," but warned under certain conditions it is possible for the "incident to persist."

A Panda spokesperson told ZDNet on Friday that it has fixed 90 percent of incidents. Without giving specific figures, the spokesperson said the incident affected "only a small part" of its install base.

It's not the first time an antimalware service has mistakenly classified core files as malware. In 2010, McAfee accidentally [deleted a crucial Windows XP file](https://www.zdnet.com/article/defective-mcafee-update-causes-worldwide-meltdown-of-xp-pcs/), leaving millions of machines bricked.

Last month, Google-owned VirusTotal [teamed up with a number of companies](https://www.zdnet.com/article/microsoft-google-join-forces-to-tackle-antivirus-false-positives/), including Microsoft, to reduce the number of false-flags in its antivirus products.
