I have World Unlimited, US Unlimited premium plans... _AND_ I have Skype Credit... WTF!!?!?!?!?! Why can I not make a simple call skype-to-skype call??!??!?!?!?!!! Why does SKYPE insist I buy more subscriptions when I have multiple premium subscriptions _and_ credit!!!!!!!!!!!!! 

Ever since M$ took over Skype, everything stops working! (except billing)

I'm cancelling everything with Skype!! Only thing that works is the damn billing.
