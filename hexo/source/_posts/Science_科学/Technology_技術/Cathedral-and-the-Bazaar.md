This is a short 40 page analog, but really classic writing on Open Source Software philosophies. Eric also explores “Management and the Maginot Line” - a few points on why a manager based approach will not outperform a community based approach to developing software.

## Rules of thumb
-    Every good work of software starts by scratching a developers personal itch.
-    Good programmers know what to write. Great ones know what to rewrite (and reuse).
-    Plan to throw one away; you will, anyhow
-    If you have the right attitude, interesting problems will find you.
-    When you lose interest in a program, your last duty of call to it is to hand it off to a competent successor
-    Treating your users as co-developers is your least-hassle route to rapid code improvement and effective debugging
-    Release early. Release often. And listen to your customers.
-    Given a large enough beta-tester and co-developer base, almost every problem will be characterized quickly and the fix obvious to someone.
-    Smart data structures and dumb code works a lot better than the other way round.
-    If you treat your beta-testers as if they’re your most valuable resource, they will respond by becoming your most valuable resource.
-    The next best thing to having good ideas is recognizing good ideas from your users. Sometimes the latter is better.
-    Often, the most striking and innovative solutions come from realizing that your concept of the problem was wrong.
-    Perfection (in design) is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but rather when there is nothing more to take away.
-    Any tool should be useful in the expected way, but a truly great tool lends itself to uses you never expected.
-    When writing gateway software of any kind, take pains to disturb the data stream as little as possible - and never throw away information unless the recipient forces you to!
-    When your language is nowhere near Turing-complete, syntactic sugar can be your friend.
-    A security system is only as secure as its secret. Beware of pseudo-secrets.
-    To solve an interesting problem, start by finding a problem that is interesting to you.
-    Provided the development coordinator has a medium at least as good as the Internet, and knows how to lead without coercion, many heads are inevitably better than one.
