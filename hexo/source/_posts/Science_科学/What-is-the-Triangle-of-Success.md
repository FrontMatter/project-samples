*Knowledge, Skills and Attitude…*


The ‘Triangle of Success’ is a concept that represents the three success ingredients: knowledge, skills, and attitude.

We have all heard phrases like competency, aptitude, capacity, potential, proficiency, and so on, which are commonly used as synonyms for the word "ability."


$
\displaystyle
f(Ablity) = { f(knowledge) + f(skills) + f(attitude) }
$

Where, *Knowledge* is useful information obtained by education, experience, or association. It is a requirement for developing talents. The capacity to accomplish specified activities, on the other hand, is referred to as a skill. Attitude refers to how individuals react to different events and how they act in general. To be successful in life, we must employ KSAs.

To achieve success in any career or element of life, knowledge, skill, and attitude are essential. Skills and expertise are less valuable without a strong work ethic.

The first component is understanding. A wall of diplomas and certificates does not demonstrate knowledge. It cannot be adequately quantified by a numerical grade point average or years of job experience. True knowledge is comprehension. Understanding what our followers want and expect from us as leaders gives real working knowledge. Without such an awareness, we are condemned to flit from one unimportant problem or activity to the next.

## Knowledge
There are two methods to gain knowledge: study and surround ourselves with others who know more than we do. Both are beneficial, but study is the most efficient. Reading is like to workout for the mind. Those who do not read are in the same boat as those who cannot read. A quarter of our reading should be outside our field of employment if we want to be more educated and fascinating.

## Skills
The second factor is ability. Is knowledge more essential than skill? We may claim that it is not more significant, but rather equally important. Personal leadership growth requires both knowledge and competence. Simply said, ability equals application. The capacity to apply a notion or idea to a task provides a distinct leadership edge. Professional courage, decisiveness, patience, and the ability to listen honestly are a few unique talents that may be quite valuable in leading followers. Each of these abilities are teachable. However, each must be used in order for the advantages to be recognized.

The majority of what has already been mentioned about knowledge also applies to the skills side of the triangle. We must constantly hone the talents we already have by putting them to use, while also learning new ones. And, as with information, there are two main methods for acquiring and honing skills: attempt new things and try existing things in new ways.

What talents we need to learn are frequently visible in our surroundings. Whatever we’re going to do, wherever we’re going to do it, we should always ask ourselves what skills will assist us improve the application of our knowledge. The engineer who created a product and then intends to sell it should obtain some sales training and possibly attend a public speaking course. In most cases, asking successful people in our profession to propose areas for development is informative.


## Attitude
Attitude is the third component in the “Triangle of Success.” Attitude is crucial. More significant than the preceding two. Why? Because attitude is synonymous with desire. Anyone can have the knowledge and skills required to achieve great things. However, if there is no personal motivation to drive behavior and performance, the final consequence will be untapped potential. In contrast, we all know people who lack tremendous knowledge and expertise, but their attitude, passion, serves and even drives them as they systematically conquer the barriers in their path. Desire is the great equalizer for them.

Being proactive, being able to get along with others, being optimistic, being critical of others, honesty, integrity, self-confidence, cooperative attitude, expectations, energy levels, optimism, and so on are all crucial for work success.

Attitude is a two-edged sword. We must not only establish positive attitudes toward ourselves, but we must also comprehend the attitudes of those with who we interact, specifically what influences their views in certain situations.

To build good connections with others, we must treat them as though we like them and find genuine methods to make them feel valued. We cannot be dull and predictable, and we must recognize that the individual we are working with has a dominating thinking that is unlikely to be the same as ours. Every person has earned the right to be treated humanely just by existing.

We all know folks who have a wealth of information and a plethora of abilities but aren’t as successful as they could be. In this scenario, the cause is frequently a notable lack of attitude.

## Ingredient: interdependence
The ambition to excel in one’s chosen job is prevalent. This desire, which is more of an intention, should develop into a strategy. Before transforming desire into an action plan, the interdependence of knowledge, skills, and attitude must be understood.

Academic knowledge serves as the basis for the selected field. Management and engineering degrees can provide us with vital information for management and technical employment.

We are competent and ahead of others in these fields because of our communication, analytical, and presenting abilities. To be effective, we must learn complementary talents based on professional requirements.

Remember the old adage that “a Ferrari never wins a race while it is in the garage.” Similarly, our potential is determined by the information and skills we gain. However, our productivity is determined by how optimistic we are.

Knowledge and skill determine our area of expertise, specialty, and field of play. To be the champion in our sector, we must develop these pillars not only by collecting information and perfecting abilities, but also by being creative. Which will aid in the exploration of new areas and new knowledge. Creativity and invention have made significant contributions to the lives of individuals and nations in terms of gaining an advantage; it has shown to be the only shortcut accessible for success.

## Developing an optimistic outlook
It is typical to encounter friends, students, and employees in companies complaining about school, market obstacles, demanding employers, and other issues, spreading negativity and discontent in their surrounds. Organizations, on the other hand, are tough and fast to deal with negativity and indiscipline.

Working with others in groups is an important part of organizations. As a result, knowing others empathically and employing a positive mindset to influence is critical for success.

Such a mindset is inherent. If we lack it, we must modify ourselves and become more optimistic. Reading books on the power of a happy attitude, viewing films on the subject, and learning from those who exude positive energy. A happy attitude spreads like wildfire; be a carrier and share it around.

However, a cheerful attitude is not something that can be maintained indefinitely. Every obstacle and struggle we face challenges our mental fortitude; constantly reinforcing our optimistic attitude after each difficult event.

## Why don’t we put more effort into cultivating positive attitudes?
First, we may believe that attitude is genetically predetermined, implying that some individuals are born optimistic while others are born pessimistic and there is nothing one can do to change it. This could not be further from the truth. While most individuals are predisposed to act in particular ways, we may modify or create specific attitudes at will. Developing or altering an attitude will need far more effort than developing a skill or knowledge, but it will also be far more useful.

The second reason individuals fail to focus on attitudes is that they are unaware of the benefits that would result from doing so. According to "common sense," the more informed someone is, the more successful he will be. While this may be true, it is only true if the individual also possesses the correct mindset.

After building attitudes (which is a lifetime process), one should concentrate on competencies. Competencies take precedence over knowledge since they are adaptable and can be employed to a wide range of circumstances.

## Summary
*Knowledge* determines our profession — Engineering, Medicine, Management, Law, Sports, Music, and so on.
*Skills* define the range of our potential. 
While *attitude* regulates the efficiency we attain. 
As a result, the **Triangle of Success** is made up of *knowledge*, *skills*, and *attitude*.
