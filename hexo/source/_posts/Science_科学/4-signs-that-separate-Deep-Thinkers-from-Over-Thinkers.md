*Get smarter at reading an intellectual‚Äôs thinking pattern and you‚Äôll save yourself a lot of time and effort.*

I read people smart wrong for most of my career.

I was always trying to determine how to identify intelligent people. Someone gave me the if you‚Äôre the smartest person in the room, get another room advice. I got really good at spotting intellectuals.

But what the person who came up with the smartest person in the room's advice forgot to mention is that there are two very different types of intellectuals.

* Deep-thinkers
* Over-thinkers

And I accidentally surrounded myself with a bunch of highly intelligent overthinkers. Before I knew it, I became an Over-thinker.

I was over thinking everything.

* What I was going to say.
* What I was going to do.
* What I was going to think.

But one day I started over thinking the Over-thinkers I surrounded myself with and I luckily got over them too.

**I‚Äôve learned**: There is a very fine line between over thinking and deep thinking.

On a surface level, they may look alike, but hidden in the invisible undercurrents that forge their thinking habits lies the difference.

* **Deep thinkers are driven by *curiosity*.**
* Over-thinkers are driven by *anxiety*.

Maybe you‚Äôre in a position where you‚Äôre doubting whether the smart people in your life are having a good influence on you. Perhaps you catch yourself over thinking and want to surround yourself with more deep thinkers. Maybe you‚Äôre exhausted of dealing with time wasters and need a couple of deep thinkers on your team.

Here are the four tell-tell signs that separate deep thinkers from Over-thinkers.

## Deep thinkers see big pictures
*Over-thinkers get stuck in the details.*

Seeing the big picture gives you a better understanding of how the different pieces fit together, which makes deep thinkers better at achieving the overall goal.

Deep thinkers are able to see the big picture because they are able to analyze and process information quickly. They are able to see patterns and trends that others may not be able to see. This ability allows them to make connections that others may not be able to make.

The problem with getting stuck in the details is that it‚Äôs easy to lose sight of the forest for the trees. When you‚Äôre focused on the little things, it‚Äôs hard to see the broader context and make decisions accordingly. This can lead to paralysis by analysis, where you never feel like you have enough information to make a decision, so you just keep gathering data instead of moving forward.

It usually starts with getting stuck on one detail, and then the next, and then the next, and before we know it, we lose sight of our goals. We end up missing opportunities.

## Deep thinkers get shit done
*Over-thinkers get paralyzed in their thoughts.*

Deep thinkers are secret quantity over quality people. (And that's a good thing.)

They understand that with quantity comes quality and they will eventually outpace the overthinker. Experiments from pottery shops all the way to photography courses have shown one simple fact:

üëâüèª The more you repeat something the better you get at it.

The more your try to see what is not the way, the more likely you are to find the way.

That‚Äôs why classical music teachers use studies that get students to build what they call ‚Äúmuscle memory‚Äù. Scientists now call it neuroplasticity which usually goes with the whole speech of neurons wiring and firing together.

Deep thinkers get sh*t done because they are able to think critically and solve problems quickly. They are able to see the big picture and make decisions based on what is best for the long-term. Deep thinkers are also able to handle stress and adversity well, which allows them to stay focused and get the job done.

One reason Over-thinkers over think is because they try to control everything. They want to have a plan for everything and they want to know what‚Äôs going to happen next.

But life doesn‚Äôt work that way.

Sometimes you have to go with the flow and see what happens.

## Deep thinkers seek discomfort
*Over-thinkers look for comfort.*

Deep thinkers tend to be more interested in seeking out new and challenging experiences, even if it means being uncomfortable.

They want to push themselves outside of their comfort zone in order to learn and grow. This willingness to face discomfort is what allows deep thinkers to thrive in new and difficult situations.

They understand that discomfort is often a necessary part of the learning process and are not afraid to embrace it. This attitude allows them to take risks and explore new ideas without being hindered by fear.

Deep thinkers are constantly pushing themselves to think more deeply and creatively, which leads to a more fulfilling and rewarding life.

Over-thinkers are often looking for comfort because they are constantly over thinking things. This can lead to a lot of anxiety and stress, which can be very overwhelming.

When you‚Äôre constantly over-thinking things, it‚Äôs easy to get lost in your own thoughts and forget about the present moment. Over-thinkers often look for comfort in order to escape from their own thoughts and relax.

## Deep thinkers delay gratification
*Over-thinkers look for instant gratification.*

In order to be successful, deep thinkers know that they need to delay gratification. They understand that if they want to achieve their long-term goals, they need to be willing to sacrifice their immediate desires.

Deep thinkers are patient people.

They are willing to wait for what they want because they know that it will be worth it in the end. They are not afraid of hard work and they are not afraid of making sacrifices.

Deep thinkers would rather wait a little bit longer and get what they really want. They know that if they want something, they need to work for it.

In a fast-paced world, it‚Äôs easy to get caught up in the need for instant gratification. We want what we want, and we want it now. The problem with this thinking is:

* Instant gratification = Long-term problems
* Delayed gratification = Long-term happiness

Choose wisely.


## Conclusion
If you take away one thing from this article, reconsider the intellectuals that you surround yourself with.

They may look alike, but they are two different species altogether.

Surround yourself with enough deep thinkers and there won‚Äôt be space left for the toxic habit of over thinking ‚Äî because when the root is deep, there is no need to fear the wind.
