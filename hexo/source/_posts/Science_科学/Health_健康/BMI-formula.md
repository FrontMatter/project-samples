 Lambert Adolphe Jacques Quetelet 1796 -1874

 The Body Mass Index(BMI) formula was developed by Belgium statistician Adolphe Quetelet (1796-1874), and was known as the Quetelet Index.   BMI is also  referred to as 'body mass indicator'. BMI is an internationally *abused* measure of obesity.

 **How to calculate BMI** - for users who wish to manually calculate BMI we have provided a bmi formula for both imperial & metric measurements (*we also offer an online [BMI Calculator](http://www.whathealth.com/bmi/calculator.html)*).
 Body mass index calculation is very straightforward. Calculating body mass index requires only two measurements, height & weight.


## Table: Imperial BMI Formula
 The imperial BMI formula accepts weight measurements in pounds & height measurements in either inches or feet.

 - 1 foot = 12 inches
 - inches² = inches * inches


$$
BMI_{(lbs/inches²)} = \frac{weight_{(lbs)} \times 703}{height_{(inches²)}}
$$

## Metric Imperial BMI Formula
 The metric BMI formula  accepts weight measurements in kilograms & height measurements in either cm's or meters.

 - 1 meter = 100cms
 - meters² = meters * meters

$$
BMI_{(kg/m²)} = \frac{weight_{(kilograms)}}{height_{(meters²)}}
$$



## Calculate BMI & Find Weight Status

| BMI            | Weight Status  |
| :---           | :----          |
| Below 18.5     | Underweight    |
| 18.5 -24.9     | Normal         |
| 25 - 29.9      | Overweight     |
| 18.5 -24.9     | Normal         |
| 30 & Above     | Obese          |


If you have calculated  BMI use the table above to find your weight status. Different nations & organizations use different BMI ranges to classify weight status.

Our  table is in keeping with the internationally recognized, [United States Deparment of Health and Human Services](http://www.hhs.gov/) weight status categories.
