 No amount of running can out-perform the chewing capacity of my mouth! You just can not out-run your own mouth. ;)

 I have ballooned 5Kg (!) over the Holidays. So, next month I intend to implement an experiment to see how fast my body can spend its storage tanks without a refill... 

 In short, I plan to fast for 30 days drinking only water and multi-vitamins. This is based on my research of how the human body adapts to environmental stresses when food is scarce. I will document the entire process.
