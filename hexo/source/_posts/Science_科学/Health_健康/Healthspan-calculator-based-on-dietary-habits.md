Interesting to see how eating more meat tends to lower life expectancy...

> Basically, removing all eggs, fish, red & white meats, and lowering oil consumption significantly increases one's potential healthspan.
> In my case, "going vegan" adds about 2 **DECADES** of life! That's enough to watch my grandkids grow up!
