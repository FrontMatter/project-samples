 As defined here: ​http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Somatotype, my body type is more like that of _Mesomorphic_.

 Sheldon's "somatotypes" and their supposed associated physical traits can be summarized as follows:

 - Ectomorphic: characterized by long and thin muscles/limbs and low fat storage; usually referred to as slim. Ectomorphs are not predisposed to store fat or build muscle.
 - Mesomorphic: characterized by medium bones, solid torso, low fat levels, wide [shoulders](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoulders) with a narrow [Waist]"(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Waist); usually referred to as muscular. Mesomorphs are predisposed to build muscle but not store fat.
 - Endomorphic: characterized by increased fat storage, a wide waist and a large bone structure, usually referred to as fat. Endomorphs are predisposed to storing fat.
