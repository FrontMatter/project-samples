 Our "culture" and ignorance will be the death of us if we don't educate ourselves and apply that knowledge properly.

## Video (33 minutes) Can we stop a future pandemic? Dr. Michael Greger M.D explains what's next.
 Dr. Greger is a physician, New York Times bestselling author, and internationally recognised speaker on nutrition, food safety, and public health issues. Dr Greger has also worked on the human health implications of intensive animal agriculture, including the routine use of non-therapeutic antibiotics and growth hormones in animals raised for food, and the public health threats of industrial factory farms. In his speech from over a decade ago, ‘Pandemics: History & Prevention’, Dr Greger spoke about the inextricable link between animal use and zoonotic disease, as well as the dangers associated with industrialised farming of birds and pigs. In this episode of The Disclosure Podcast we discuss those dangers, as well as how to prevent the next pandemic.
