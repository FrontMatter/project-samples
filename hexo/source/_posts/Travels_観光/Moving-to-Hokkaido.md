My Hokkaido goals this winter:
 
 - Test living (long-term) in Snow-Country virtually risk free.
 - Learn what I must know to survive in Snow-Country.
 - Discover what makes a great house in the winter
     - What features are required?
 - Learn about the winter chores required for house up-keep.
 - Learn about the culture and neighborhood.
 - See how my wife and sons react to living in Snow-Country.
 - And, of course, enjoy the winter paradise!

 If I confirm there are more positives than negatives, then I will make Hokkaido my permanent home. Until then, I need to continue this trial.
