I have finally resolved 95% of the issues/bugs with the new travel log section.

The features now include:

- Tab browsing
- single click navigation with the Plog (Photo Log)
- custom namespace for advanced functions.<
- Summary details are displayed when mouse hovers over image.
- Google Map
- embedded images inline with text. All images use the [ attach ] tag that references the DataBase for object details.
- <i>(Planned feature) Video support with vid's from YouTube</i>


Little by little, I am growing my little site.
